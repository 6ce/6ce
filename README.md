I've given up GitHub. It's "the Facebook of software development".

I'll leave my past projects up, but they will not be updated here. You can now find any new/updated projects @ https://codeberg.org/magnet, and you can contact me @ https://t.me/hanukkahween.

You can also contact me over Session @ 05f96b7905e3b65c6dd362e64bdacba977ace7b35786790aa9f4e750d617712924.
